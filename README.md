Class libraries for FZB Framework.

**Requires PHP 8.1!**

**Work in progress!  Expect functionality to break!**

FZB Framework is a lightweight web framework that implements modern PHP 8.1 features.  It provides a router, input validator, template renderer, DB abstration layer, and lightweight ORM.  It currently is designed as a drop-in framework for deploying on shared/dedicated Apache servers, but will eventually include the ability to be run as a stand-alone application server.

To use, add to your composer.json:
```
    "require": {
        "fzb/fzb": "dev-master"
    }
```
Then run:
```
composer update
```

You can use as many or as few Fzb objects as you need in your project.
