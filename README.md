Class libraries for FZB Framework.

FZB Framework is a lightweight web framework that implements modern PHP 8.1 features.  It provides a router, input validator, template renderer, DB abstration layer, and lightweight ORM.  It currently is designed as a drop-in framework for deploying on shared/dedicated Apache servers, but will eventually include the ability to be run as a stand-alone application server.

This library is currently a work-in-progress.
